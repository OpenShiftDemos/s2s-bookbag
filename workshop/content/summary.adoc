Congratulations! You're now ready to go out into the world and make serverless, intelligent applications. You have seen: 

- how OpenShift streamlines the path from discovery to production for data scientists and developers alike,
- the advantages of serverless for machine learning systems,
- how to train, evaluate, and publish models in a contemporary serverless architecture,
- how to monitor models in production and detect failures before they cause problems, and
- how to start incorporating intelligent features into your apps.
