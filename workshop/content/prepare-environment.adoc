In this section we will guide you through the process of accessing and logging in to the OpenShift console. 

Over the next few minutes you will:

- log into OpenShift
- access your OpenShift project 

=== Logging into the Openshift Console


Visit **VISIT WEBSITE?** where you should see a screen like this:

image::ocp-login.png[]

Enter your username and password:

Your username is: *{USERNAME}*

Your password is: *{PASSWORD}*

Once you enter your details and click `Log In` you will be taken to a page that looks something like this: 

image::landing-page.png[]

__(Note that your project name and the username in the top right hand corner will differ from what you see here, showing your username instead.)__

Go ahead and click on your project name to access your personal project:

image::landing-page-hlt.png[]

__(The project name is shown here as 'opendatahub-user1', but yours will be 'opendatahub-*{USERNAME}*.)__


This will take you to your project access page: 

image::project-landing-page.png[]
__Note that again your project name will differ from that shown in the image above._

Congratulations! You are now logged into OpenShift 4. In the next section we will log into JupyterHub.
