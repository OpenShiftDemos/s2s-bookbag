**THIS IS TO DO PIPELINE INSTRUCTIONS**


In this section you will:

- log into OpenShift, and
- access your OpenShift project. 

=== Logging into the Openshift Console


Visit https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-{USER_GUID}.{USER_GUID}.events.opentlc.com/ where you will see a screen like this:

Enter your username and password:

Your username is: *{USERNAME}*

Your password is: *{PASSWORD}*

Once you enter your details and click `Log In` you will be taken to a page that looks something like this: 

image::images/landing-page.png[width=750]

__(Note that your project name and the username in the top right hand corner will differ from what you see here, reflecting your username instead.)__

Go ahead and click on your project name to access your personal project:

image::images/landing-page-hlt.png[width=750]

__(The project name is shown here as 'opendatahub-user1', but yours will be 'opendatahub-*{USERNAME}*.)__


This will take you to a page showing your project details: 

image::images/project-landing-page.png[width=750]
__Note that again your project name will differ from that shown in the image above.__

Congratulations! You are now logged into OpenShift 4 and have accessed your Project, where you will be working today. In the next section we will log into JupyterHub.
