== Overview


This workshop is designed to show application developers how to incorporate machine learning workflows into their everyday engineering discipline.  Our goal is for developers who are excited about machine learning to learn three important things in the context of a real application, namely detecting spam messages:

- how to use machine learning to solve a real problem, from visualization to a deployable model that can run as an application component;
- how to evaluate and validate predictive models, and some metrics that are more useful than raw accuracy;
- how OpenShift enables every stage of machine learning discovery and production, including trying different approaches to solve a problem.

=== Background and workshop flow

The main structure of the workshop is given by [the notebooks](../source). 

If you haven't used Jupyter notebooks before, please refer to https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface[the user documentation at Project Jupyter] to get comfortable with explaining details of how things work to users.  Some things to keep in mind, though, are:

- Jupyter notebooks are a literate programming environment combining _cells_ containing narration and cells containing code.  When a user executes a code cell, the output of running the code (whether a value, a table of records, a graph, or an error) is appended to the code cell.
- Shift+Enter always executes the current cell and advances to the next one.  *This is really all of the Jupyter interface anyone absolutely needs to know.*
- Cells only run if you execute them, you can run a cell more than once, you can edit a cell and run it again (or not).  This can be confusing!  Don't assume that you can reproduce the output in a notebook you've seen 
- If you get really stuck, head up to the `Kernel` menu and select `Restart and clear output` to start fresh.

The notebooks are numbered in order (and, for the most part, need to be run in order); here's how you'll go through the workshop:

- `00-generator.ipynb` is the generator we use for our synthetic data -- "legitimate" messages are based on the novels of Jane Austen, while "spam" messages are based on reviews of food products from a retail website.  _This notebook can be safely skipped in a shorter workshop; we have pregenerated a training dataset in the `data` folder._
- `01-vectors-and-visualization.ipynb` shows how to turn English-language text into vectors of numbers and visualize these vectors to see whether we can identify any structure in the data.  This is an important first step of exploratory analysis.  We recommend walking through this notebook cell-by-cell with the students and explaining what's happening -- there's a lot of narration in the notebook, but let us know if anything could be clearer!
- `02-evaluating-models.ipynb` shows how to evaluate whether or not a _binary classifier_ (that is, a model that takes an input and puts it in to one of two classes -- in this case "spam" or "legitimate") is effective.  It discusses some of the pitfalls with model training, in particular, it covers the problems with using raw accuracy and explains what some better metrics are and when one might want to use them.  We recommend walking through this notebook cell-by-cell with the students and explaining what's happening.

The next part of the workshop allows you to decide how you'll want to solve the problem.  We offer two different approaches to _feature engineering_, or extracting valuable signals from raw data in a way that a ML algorithm can exploit, and two different approaches to training predictive models with these features.  This means that as long as you run one of the feature engineering notebooks (starting with `03-`) and one of the model training notebooks (starting with `04-`), you'll have a complete approach to going from raw data to a prediction.

Here are the notebooks for this part of the workshop:

- `03-feature-engineering-summaries.ipynb` shows how to extract features based on some summary statistics about the text;
- `03-feature-engineering-tfidf.ipynb` shows how to use term frequency-inverse document frequency and hashing to generate features capturing words appearing in each document;
- `04-model-logistic-regression.ipynb` shows how to train a logistic regression model to distinguish between legitimate and spam documents; and
- `04-model-random-forest.ipynb` shows how to train an ensemble of decision trees to distinguish between legitimate and spam documents.

Try some different options!  Did anything improve your model's performance or make it noticeably worse?

Data drift is the phenomenon in which a predictive model loses effectiveness because the distribution of the data it is evaluating in the real world has materially diverged from the data it was trained on.  (For a real-world example, think back to the early days of automated spam filtering and the cat-and-mouse game that email scammers played with email providers -- messages for pharmaceuticals might escape detection one week, while messages for gambling or dubious mortgages might escape detection the next.)

It's time to return to OpenShift and see how we can use it to make machine learning systems better.  Here are the notebooks you'll use:

- `05-data-drift.ipynb` explains the problem of data drift and shows a common technique used by real-world spammers to escape detection, and
- `06-pipelines.ipynb` shows how we can define _machine learning pipelines_ consisting of preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training stages and then reuse these to retrain a model or try different learning approaches.

Source-to-image is an extremely powerful tool to make machine learning discovery reproducible, and it's also an excellent way for data scientists to communicate their work to application developers.  We'll see how to use s2i to make a learning pipeline into a REST microservice.

Next up, we'll want to use the model service to make predictions, and for that, we'll go back to Jupyter.

- `07-services.ipynb` presents a small client library for interacting with our pipeline service; it shows how to make predictions over REST and demonstrates how Prometheus metrics can help to identify data drift.

There's one notebook left, and it's more or less "extra credit":

- `99-baseline.ipynb` shows the classic Naive Bayes spam classification technique, which formed the basis for the first successful automatic spam classifiers.  You are unlikely to tune the other approaches so that they outperform Naive Bayes, but you may have fun trying!

Enjoy!
